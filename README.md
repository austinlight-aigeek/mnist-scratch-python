## MNIST image classification using Python - Scratch

This example shows how to build `Convolution Neural Network` model from scratch to classify `MNIST` images.
Accuracy of this project is about 95.2%.
Anyone can increase accuracy by modifying hyper-parameters of it.

- To run project run `TestMnistConv.py`
